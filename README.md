#Notes and Lists

This is a note taking app that is developed using plain Javascript. This app lets users to create notes and lists. Some of the features include:

1. Pinning the notes/lists to top
2. Changing colors of the notes/lists
3. List items can be marked as done which will appear in another section within the same list
4. View styles: grid or list
5. Note/list titles can be added

Possible future updates for this:

1. Saving the notes to the local storage using localStorage
2. Right now, when an item is marked as 'done', it cannot be added back to unchecked items. So this feature can be added in the future
3. Categorize lists and notes (work, school, home, shopping etc.)

Environments used:
1. HTML: used as a markup language for the app
2. CSS: for styling the said app
3. JS: for creating new and updating the already present items in both HTML and CSS
4. Adobe Illustrator: for designing the app's logo
